## 2D Heat Equation

In the case of the 2D heat equation, which describes how heat diffuses through a two-dimensional surface over time, a PINN can learn the temperature distribution across space and time by minimizing the residual of the heat equation at sampled points in the domain.

$$
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right), \quad (x, y) \in \Omega, \ t > 0
$$

Futhermore, we consider the following initial condision and boundary conditions for the system,

$$
    u(x, y, 0) = sin(\pi x) sin(\pi y), \quad (x, y) \in \Omega \\ \\
$$

$$
    u(x, 1, t) = 1, \quad u(x, y, t) = 0, \quad (x, y) \in \partial \Omega, \ t > 0
$$


## What is Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)?

In simple terms, machine learning for science equations(but not limited to it). A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a type of deep learning model that incorporates physical laws—typically expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs)—directly into the training process of the neural network. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on labeled data, PINNs are trained using both data (if available) and the governing physical equations, enabling them to learn accurate solutions even with limited or no data.

To learn a model, we try to tune the network’s free parameters (denoted by the \thetas in the figure above) so that the network’s predictions closely match the available experimental data. This is usually done by minimising the mean-squared-error between its predictions and the training points;

$$
    \begin{align}
    \min \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( u_{\text{NN}}(x_i; \theta) - u_{\text{true}}(x_i) \right)^2
    \end{align}
$$


## Julia Implementation and Code Walkthrough

{% highlight javascript %}
<d-code block language="javascript">
    using NeuralPDE, Lux, Optimization, OptimizationOptimJL
    using ModelingToolkit: Interval
</d-code>
{% endhighlight %}

We use NeuralPDE.jl for defining and solving PDEs, Lux.jl for neural networks, and ModelingToolkit.jl for symbolic definitions.

{% highlight javascript %}
<d-code block language="javascript">
    @parameters t, x, y
    @variables u(..)
    Dx = Differential(x); Dy = Differential(y); Dt = Differential(t)
    Dxx = Dx^2; Dyy = Dy^2
</d-code>
{% endhighlight %}

We symbolically define the time and space variables along with their partial derivatives.

{% highlight javascript %}
<d-code block language="javascript">
    α = 1.0
    eq = Dt(u(t, x, y)) ~ α * (Dxx(u(t, x, y)) + Dyy(u(t, x, y)))
    domains = [
        t ∈ Interval(0.0, 1.0),
        x ∈ Interval(0.0, 1.0),
        y ∈ Interval(0.0, 1.0)
    ]
    ic = u(0, x, y) ~ 0
    bcs = [
        u(t, 0, y) ~ 0.0,
        u(t, 1, y) ~ 0.0,
        u(t, x, 0) ~ 0.0,
        u(t, x, 1) ~ 1.0
    ]
    @named pde_system = PDESystem(eq, [ic; bcs], domains, [t, x, y], [u(t, x, y)])
</d-code>
{% endhighlight %}

We define the complete PDE system including equations and constraints.

{% highlight javascript %}
<d-code block language="javascript">
    dx = 0.05
    chain = Chain(Dense(3, 32, tanh), Dense(32, 32, tanh), Dense(32, 1))
    discretization = PhysicsInformedNN(chain, GridTraining(dx))
    prob = discretize(pde_system, discretization)
    losses = []

    callback = function (p, l)
        println("Current loss is: $l")
        push!(losses, l)
        return false
    end
    using OptimizationOptimisers
    opt1 = OptimizationOptimisers.Adam(0.01)
    res1 = Optimization.solve(prob, opt1; callback=callback, maxiters=1000)
    phi = discretization.phi
</d-code>
{% endhighlight %}

This part sets up and trains the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the 2D heat equation. It defines the neural network architecture, discretizes the PDE using grid-based training, and initializes the optimization problem. Training is performed using the ADAM optimizer with a callback to monitor loss, and the final trained model (phi) can be used to predict the solution over the domain.

{% highlight javascript %}
<d-code block language="javascript">
    xs = ys = range(0, 1, length=50)
    t_plot = 0.0  # Fixed time
    u_predict = [sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y) for x in xs, y in ys]
    heatmap(xs, ys, u_predict', xlabel="x", ylabel="y", title="2D domain at t = $t_plot", 
            color=:viridis, colorbar=true, colorbar_title="Temperature")
    anim = @animate for t_plot in 0:0.005:1.0
        u = [phi([t_plot, x, y], res.u)[1] for x in xs, y in ys]
        heatmap(0:0.02:1, 0:0.02:1, u', title="t = $t_plot", xlabel="x", ylabel="y", clims=(0,1))
    end
    gif(anim, "newheat2d.gif", fps=10)
    plot(1:length(losses), log10.(losses),
        xlabel="Iteration", ylabel="log(Loss)",
        title="Error Plot (log(Loss) vs Iteration)",
        label="Training Loss", linewidth=2)
</d-code>
{% endhighlight %}

After training the PINN model, we can visualize its predictions over time and space. The following Julia code uses the Plots.jl library to create both static heatmaps and animated GIFs showing the temperature evolution in the 2D domain.
